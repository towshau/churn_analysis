## Coach Workbook Optimizations

### InBody Weight and Body Fat Percentage Graphs

**Description:** InBody weight and body fat percentage graphs are now attached within the 360 dashboard, eliminating the need to manually access coach workbooks and PDFs for comparisons.

**Previous Process:**
- Time per client: **2.5 minutes**
- Steps: Log into coach workbooks, locate PDFs, perform comparisons

**New Process:**
- Time per client: **15 seconds**
- Steps: Direct access via 360 dashboard

**Time Savings Calculation:**
- Time saved per client: 2.5 minutes - 15 seconds = **2 minutes 15 seconds** (135 seconds)
- Clients per coach: **30**
- Frequency: **Once per week**
- Weeks per year: **52**

**Total Time Saved per Coach per Year:**
- Per client: 135 seconds
- Per week: 135 seconds × 30 clients = **4,050 seconds** (67.5 minutes)
- Per year: 4,050 seconds × 52 weeks = **210,600 seconds** = **3,510 minutes** = **58.5 hours**

**Cost Analysis (Average Coach Rate: $55/hour):**

**Before Optimization:**
- Time per client: 2.5 minutes = 0.04167 hours
- Cost per client: 0.04167 hours × $55 = **$2.29**
- Cost per week: $2.29 × 30 clients = **$68.70**
- Cost per year: $68.70 × 52 weeks = **$3,572.40**

**After Optimization:**
- Time per client: 15 seconds = 0.00417 hours
- Cost per client: 0.00417 hours × $55 = **$0.23**
- Cost per week: $0.23 × 30 clients = **$6.90**
- Cost per year: $6.90 × 52 weeks = **$358.80**

**Annual Cost Savings per Coach:**
- Time saved: 58.5 hours
- Cost savings: 58.5 hours × $55/hour = **$3,217.50/year**
- Alternative calculation: $3,572.40 (before) - $358.80 (after) = **$3,213.60/year**
