## Coach Workbook Optimizations

### InBody Weight and Body Fat Percentage Graphs

**Description:** InBody weight and body fat percentage graphs are now attached within the 360 dashboard, eliminating the need to manually access coach workbooks and PDFs for comparisons.

**Previous Process:**
- Time per client: **2.5 minutes**
- Steps: Log into coach workbooks, locate PDFs, perform comparisons

**New Process:**
- Time per client: **15 seconds**
- Steps: Direct access via 360 dashboard

**Time Savings Calculation:**
- Time saved per client: 2.5 minutes - 15 seconds = **2 minutes 15 seconds** (135 seconds)
- Clients per coach: **30**
- Frequency: **Once per week**
- Weeks per year: **52**

**Total Time Saved per Coach per Year:**
- Per client: 135 seconds
- Per week: 135 seconds × 30 clients = **4,050 seconds** (67.5 minutes)
- Per year: 4,050 seconds × 52 weeks = **210,600 seconds** = **3,510 minutes** = **58.5 hours**

**Annual Impact:**
- Time saved per coach: **58.5 hours/year**
- If multiplied by hourly rate, this represents significant cost savings in coach time allocation
